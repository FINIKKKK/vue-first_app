# My first Vue.js application

The project is my first experience working with the Vue.js framework and includes all the basic knowledge of its usage.

It includes creating components, writing directives, using built-in and custom events, reactivity, computed properties, and component lifecycle. It also involves working with APIs, such as using axios to fetch data and update components when that data changes. Other important elements of the project include using Vuex for managing application state and routing the application using Vue Router.
